## Installation

Via [Bower](http://bower.io/):

```bash
bower install angular-annotorious
```

Via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install angular-annotorious
```

In a browser:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://annotorious.github.com/latest/annotorious.css" media="screen" />
<script src="http://annotorious.github.com/latest/annotorious.min.js"></script>
<script src="angular-annotorious.js"></script>
```

## Getting Started

Include the Annotorious plug-in and the directive on a page.

Basic with attribute
```html
<img src="http://annotorious.github.io/img/splash-image-1.jpg" annotorious-annotate>
```

Basic with dynamic src
```html
{{imgURL=http://annotorious.github.io/img/splash-image-1.jpg}}

<img ng-src="{{imgURL}}" annotorious-annotate>
```

Basic with tag
```html
<img id="anno1" src="http://annotorious.github.io/img/splash-image-1.jpg">

<annotorious options="{annotationsFor:'#anno1'}" />
```

Dynamic Query URLs

Do the image URLs change somehow between page load? (E.g. differences im the query string?)
You can add a "data-original" attribute to the image. Annotorious will then use the value of this attribute as the identifier/src used to re-associate annotations with images. 

```html
<img  src="http://any.long.url/that-could-change.jpg?foo=randomtoken" 
      data-original="stable-identifier-for-image"
      annotorious-annotate>
```


Multiple with tag
```html
<img class="group" src="http://annotorious.github.io/img/splash-image-1.jpg">
<img class="group" src="http://annotorious.github.io/img/splash-image-1.jpg">

<annotorious options="{annotationsFor:'.group'}" />
```

## Using the angular annotarious service

You may want for very good reasons to create annotations programmatically, or reset them all together.
There is a very good angular service called 'annotoriousService' that helps you with that:

Assuming you have an image <img> element that has a src attribute.
```javascript
var  photo = jQuery(document).find(".your-image")[0];
```

You could call:
```javascript
annotoriousService.makeAnnotatable(photo);
```
If you want to reset/reload all annotations in the page:
```javascript
annotoriousService.reset();
```

If you want to set the design of the annotation:
```javascript
annotoriousService.setProperties({
            outline: '#00f',
            stroke: '#ff0000',
            fill: 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3)',
            'hi_stroke': '#00ff00',
            'hi_fill': 'rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)'
        });
```

All web applications define their flow/lifecycle. Therefore you may need to adapt the annotorious by calling the reset() method a bit more often.

Saving is done transparently assuming you created a storage provider that uses the annotorious plugin lifecycle.


## Storage providers

The storage provider examples are under [src/storage-providers/](https://github.com/igorlino/angular-annotorious/tree/master/js/storage-providers)

There is one example that shows how to save and load annotations to/from the local browser storage. Just as the example, all providers are plug-in for annotorious

It should give you an idea how to do it for other type of storage providers.

If you happen to create another interesting storage provider, that ends up generic enough, you may consider/like to contribute it for the angular-annotorious community, your are very welcome.
